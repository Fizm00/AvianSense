# 🎉 Bird Species Classification App 🦜

Welcome to the **Bird Species Classification** application! This app uses machine learning to classify bird species from images. It allows you to upload an image of a bird, get predictions, and explore a gallery of bird species. 

## 🚀 Features
- **Upload Image**: Upload an image of a bird for classification.
- **Prediction**: Get accurate predictions on the bird species using a trained model.
- **Gallery**: Explore a gallery with a wide variety of bird species.
- **User-Friendly**: Easy-to-use interface for anyone to try.

## 🦾 Model Information
This application uses a pre-trained model that is based on the **CUB-200-2011** dataset. The model has been trained to classify birds with high accuracy (around **90%**!). 🦉

The **CUB-200-2011** dataset can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/veeralakrishna/200-bird-species-with-11788-images/data).
